        <ul>
            <li>During the next 2 years I will learn to select appropriate language and writing structure for a variety of different text types (i.e. imaginative, informative and persuasive)</li>
				<ol>
					<li>Deliberately structure language in a way that creates more cohesive imaginative, informative and persuasive texts. &#10004;</li>
					<li>Select appropriate language for purpose, e.g. descriptive, persuasive, topic, technical, evaluative, emotive, and colloquial. &#10004;</li>
					<li>Make appropriate choices about the type and form of texts, including combinations of forms and types, to suit purpose and audience.</li>
					<li>Select some sophisticated and subtle language features, literary devices (e.g. irony, humour) and grammatical features (e.g. modality) to engage and influence an audience.</li>
					<li>Make sentence level choices (e.g. short sentences to build tension; complex sentences to add detail) using a variety of sentence beginnings and dependent clauses.</li>
				</ol>
            <br>
            <li>Throughout the next 2 years I will look at a variety of styles of text to understand the differences of the language and stucture used within them</li>
				<ol>
					<li>Analyse and compare how information and ideas are presented in texts &#10004;</li>
					<li>Critically examine a wide range of texts to compare how ideas are presented &#10004;</li>
					<li>Examine several different texts on one topic and present a summary of information and ideas that show an understanding of the topic &#10004;</li>
					<li>Examine texts to see how language structures and features are used</li>
				</ol>
            <br>
            <li>The next 2 years I will further enhance my vocabulary and punctuation library and use them correctly</li>
				<ol>
					<li>Experiment with using complex punctuation to engage the reader and achieve my purpose. &#10004;</li>
					<li>Apply my knowledge of generalisations, meanings of base words and word parts (prefixes and suffixes) to spell new words.</li>
					<li>Use a range of punctuation to enhance meaning and clarity, including the use of brackets to enclose additional information, quotation marks and commas to indicate clauses. &#10004;</li>
					<li>Integrate a range of spelling strategies and conventions to accurately spell most words, including words of many syllables.</li>
				</ol>
        </ul>
        <h2> My Completed Goals </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>These 2 years I will further develop skills in making connections with actions and events to future events and consequences &#10004;</li>
            <br>
            <li>Over the next 2 years I will develop skills in looking at texts from a variety of different views other than my own &#10004;</li>
            <br>
            <li>During the next 2 years I will practise my handwriting to develop my own style that is legible. &#10004;</li>
